# NutriClass-Food-Classification-Using-Nutritional-Data
In an age where dietary awareness is paramount, understanding food through its nutritional content is vital. **NutriClass** is a machine learning project aimed at classifying food items into distinct categories using their nutritional profiles. By analyzing tabular data (such as **calories**, **proteins**, **carbohydrates**, **fats**, and **sugar**), we build a robust multi-class classification system that can power intelligent health applications and provide meaningful dietary insights.

## 🧭 Approach

### 1. 📊 Data Understanding and Exploration

- Load the food dataset and examine class distributions.  
- Visualize data to understand inter-class variations.  
- Assess data size, class imbalance, and potential noise.  

### 2. 🧹 Data Preprocessing

- Handle missing values (impute or drop as needed).  
- Detect and treat outliers (remove or cap).  
- Eliminate duplicate records.  
- Normalize or standardize numerical features.  

### 3. 🧱 Feature Engineering

- Reduce dimensionality using **PCA** or other feature selection methods.  
- Encode categorical labels using **Label Encoding** or **One-Hot Encoding**.  

### 4. 🤖 Model Selection and Training

Train and compare performance of multiple classifiers:

- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- K-Nearest Neighbors  
- Support Vector Machine  
- XGBoost  
- Gradient Boosting Classifier  

### 5. 📈 Evaluation

- Use metrics like **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, **F1-score**.  
- Visualize confusion matrices and classification reports.  
- Compare performance across models to determine the best-performing approach.

## ✅ Expected Results

- A comparative analysis of multiple machine learning models for food classification.  
- Identification of the best feature-model combination for accuracy and interpretability.  
- Graphical representation of model performance to support evaluation.
